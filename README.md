# 🐊 Animated Login & Registration Page

A modern, responsive login and registration form with smooth panel switching and animated character images that swap sides depending on the active mode.  
Inspired by playful UI design — featuring a crocodile and a girl with a bird that appear beside friendly greetings.

## ⚙️ Setup & Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP
2. Place your images (`girl.png` and `mybackground.png`) in the project folder
3. Record a GIF preview of the animation and save it as `preview.gif`
4. Open `index.html` in your browser to preview
5. Customize the text, colors, or images in the HTML & CSS files

---

## 🛠️ Customization
- Replace `girl.png` and `mybackground.png` with your own images
- Change greetings in the HTML (`Jambo, Rafiki!`, `Karibu Tena!`) to your own messages
- Adjust positions in CSS by modifying:
  ```css
  .left-img { left: 20px; }
  .right-img { right: 20px; }
````

* Change colors in `style.css` to fit your branding

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

The layout is responsive, but large decorative images may be hidden or resized on mobile to avoid covering text and buttons.

## 📄 License

This project is open-source and free to use for personal and commercial projects.

If you want, I can **make you the `preview.gif`** from your actual HTML so you don’t have to figure out the recording part yourself.  
Do you want me to make it for you?
